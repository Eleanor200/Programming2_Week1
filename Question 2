Difference between JVM, JRE and JDK

JVM (Java Virtual Machine)
It is an abstract machine that enables the running of a java program on a computer. It is virtual because
it does not physically exist. JVM performs the following main tasks:
-it loads codes
-it verifies codes
-it executes codes
-it provides the runtime environment
JVM is a specification that provides a runtime environment where a java bytecode can be executed.

JRE (Java Runtime Environment)
It is also known as Java RTE. It is a software package that provides java class libraries, JVM and other
components needed to run a java application. It is used for providing the runtime environment.
When it comes to running java programs without developing them, we use JRE
JRE is a SUPERSET of JVM. It physically exist and is an implementation of JVM.

JDK (Java Development Kit)
It is a software development kit that is required to develop applications in java. It physically exist
and contains the JRE and development tools. JDK contains a private JVM and few other resources such as 
interpreters(java), compilers(javac), an archiver(jar), a documentation generator (Javadoc), etc. to complete
 the development of a Java Application.
